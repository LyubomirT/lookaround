# Code of Conduct

Lookaround is a cool website that lets you turn your image into a 3D panorama that you can look around, and also lets you tweak some settings to make it look awesome. We made it super easy and fun to use, so you can get the best results with minimal hassle!

We want Lookaround to be a friendly and welcoming place for everyone who uses it, contributes to it, or gives us feedback on it. So, we ask you to follow this code of conduct when you chat with others in the project.
